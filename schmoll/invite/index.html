Salutations my friends. Some time ago I found myself privy to a /special/ gathering of like-minded persons. Over wine, beer, liquor and an assortment of hyper-pretentious (yet oddly arousing) surrealist cinema this haphazard group expererienced a certain type of coming-together. With March upon us, I hereby invite you to the successor of that memorable function. Live the future, the new now, now.

My flashlight lover, on a high wire she hung. <strong>Saturday.</strong> From a flustered motivation came the next decapitation. <strong>March 8th.</strong> It is an ordeal in dense foliage. <strong>9:00pm</strong> The morning is caked in orange. <strong>Come in pairs.</strong>

<strong>From Brooklyn & Manhattan</strong>

<br><br><em>trains every 10 minutes before 1am, every 15-20 minutes until 3am</em>
<br><br>
<strong>Note:</strong> The World Trade Center PATH station is closed every weekend for the remainder of 2014. If you try to catch the train at WTC you will be bitterly dissapointed.
