Determine what kind of event you are hosting on a casual to formal scale.  Our invitations and announcements are perfect for a casual to semi-casual fête.  Your personal wording should reflect the nature of the party.  Then follow the old “who, what, where, when and why” rule of thumb, only not necessarily in that order.  Imagine yourself standing face-to-face with an invitee – in what order would you normally give the information in a casual conversation?
